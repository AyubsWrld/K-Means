## 3.3 Mobile Application Specifications

The mobile application will serve as the primary tool for drivers to receive and complete their deliveries. It will incorporate various features to optimize performance, enhance usability, and support real-time operations. The following are the key features included in the mobile app:

### **3.3.1 Key Features**

#### **Offline-First Architecture**
The mobile application will be designed with an offline-first approach, ensuring that the app remains fully functional even in areas with poor or no internet connectivity.

- **Local Storage**: Delivery data, maps, and route information will be cached locally, allowing drivers to access crucial information without needing an active internet connection.
