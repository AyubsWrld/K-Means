## 3.2.1 Required APIs

To power the route optimization platform and provide real-time updates and efficient route planning, the system will rely on several external APIs. These APIs are selected for their reliability, comprehensive data, and integration ease.

### **Google Maps Platform**

Google Maps Platform provides the essential geospatial data and mapping services necessary for routing, geocoding, and navigation.

#### **Directions API**
The Directions API allows the system to calculate optimal driving routes, taking into account multiple stops and providing turn-by-turn navigation. This API is essential for:

- **Route Optimization**: Calculates efficient routes based on a series of stops.
- **Dynamic Re-routing**: Adjusts routes in real-time based on traffic conditions or new delivery requests.
- **Time and Distance Estimates**: Provides accurate estimations for travel time and distance, crucial for optimizing delivery schedules.


#### **Geocoding API**
The Geocoding API is used to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), which are essential for plotting delivery locations on the map. This API supports:

- **Address to Coordinates Conversion**: Converts delivery addresses into precise geospatial coordinates, enabling accurate mapping.
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Converts GPS coordinates into human-readable addresses, assisting with real-time updates and location validation.

### **Traffic Data**

#### **Traffic API**
Real-time traffic data is vital for dynamic re-routing and ensuring that deliveries are optimized for current road conditions. The Traffic API provides data on:

- **Traffic Conditions**: Offers real-time traffic information, including congestion levels and delays.
- **Incident Reports**: Provides details about accidents, roadworks, or other incidents that might impact travel times.
- **Traffic Prediction**: Helps predict the potential future traffic conditions on a route, allowing for smarter route planning.

### **Weather Services**

#### **OpenWeatherMap API**
Weather conditions can greatly affect delivery efficiency, particularly for vehicles operating in regions with harsh or rapidly changing climates. The OpenWeatherMap API will provide:

- **Current Weather Data**: Information on temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions, which can be used to optimize delivery routes and adjust schedules.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Predicts upcoming weather conditions along the delivery route to adjust plans in advance for potential disruptions.
- **Severe Weather Alerts**: Provides warnings for adverse weather conditions such as storms or floods, which could impact road safety or delivery timing.
