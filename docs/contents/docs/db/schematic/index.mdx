# User Authentication System Documentation

## Database: Supabase

The application uses Supabase as its backend database and authentication service. Supabase is a powerful, open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, instant APIs, and realtime subscriptions.

## Key Files and Their Roles

### 1. `lib/supabase.js`

This file sets up the Supabase client:

- Imports necessary polyfills and libraries
- Defines Supabase URL and anonymous key
- Creates and exports a Supabase client instance with specific configuration:
  - Uses AsyncStorage for persistent session storage
  - Enables auto-refresh for authentication tokens
  - Persists user sessions
- Sets up an AppState event listener to manage token refreshing based on app state

### 2. `Auth.js` (React Native Component)

This file contains the main authentication UI and logic:

- Imports necessary React Native and Supabase components
- Defines the `Auth` component which includes:
  - State management for email, password, and loading status
  - Functions for signing in and signing up using Supabase authentication
  - UI elements for email/password input and submit buttons

## How It All Works Together

1. **Supabase Client Initialization**: 
   - The `supabase.js` file initializes the Supabase client with the correct URL and API key.
   - It sets up persistent storage and auto-refresh for authentication tokens.

2. **User Interface**: 
   - The `Auth.js` component provides a user interface for sign-in and sign-up.
   - It manages local state for user input (email and password).

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - When a user attempts to sign in or sign up, the respective function (`signInWithEmail` or `signUpWithEmail`) is called.
   - These functions use the Supabase client (imported from `supabase.js`) to interact with Supabase's authentication API.
   - For sign-in, it uses `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`.
   - For sign-up, it uses `supabase.auth.signUp()`.

4. **Session Management**:
   - After successful authentication, Supabase handles session management.
   - The session is stored persistently using AsyncStorage.
   - Token refresh is managed automatically when the app is in the foreground.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Any errors during authentication are captured and displayed to the user via `Alert.alert()`.

This setup provides a complete authentication system with a clean separation of concerns:
- Database and API interactions are abstracted through the Supabase client.
- UI and user interactions are handled in the React Native component.
- Authentication state is managed by Supabase, with the app responding to auth state changes.
