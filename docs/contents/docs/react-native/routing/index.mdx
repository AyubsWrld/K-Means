# Navigation

Welcome to the contribution guide for Lucidity documentation! This guide will walk you through adding navigation to new pages.

## How Navigation Works

We use the **Stack Navigator** library from React Navigation to manage navigation within the app.

## Install Dependencies

To begin, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-screens react-native-gesture-handler
```

Additionally, you will need these dependencies:

```bash
npm install @react-native-masked-view/masked-view @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
```

## Adding a New Screen

1. **Import the stack navigator**:

```javascript
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
```

2. **Add the new screen to the navigator**:

```javascript
<Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
  <Stack.Screen name="NewScreen" component={NewScreenComponent} />
</Stack.Navigator>
```

## Disabling Header

To hide the top header, set `headerShown` to `false`:

```javascript
<Stack.Screen name="NewScreen" component={NewScreenComponent} options={{ headerShown: false }} />
```

## Adding New Pages to the Stack

To add new pages to the stack we must pass in `naviation` as a prop to all of the functional components . This is necessary for later writing the logic to transition between pages .

```javascript
export default function Onboarding({navigation}) 
```
After we have passed in the `navigation` to our functional components we can write logic which will trigger the transition from one page to another

```javascript
<Button onPress={() => navigation.navigate("Page-ID")}></Button> 
```
