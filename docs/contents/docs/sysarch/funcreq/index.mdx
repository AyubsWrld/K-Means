## 2.1 Functional Requirements

To build a successful route optimization platform, the core functionality must address the unique needs of delivery logistics, ensuring routes are optimized for multiple stops, changing traffic conditions, and various delivery constraints. Below are the essential functional requirements for the platform, with emphasis on route optimization , envvironmental efficiency , and customer satisfaction .

### 2.1.1 Route Optimization Core

The platform's route optimization core will be responsible for creating efficient and reliable routes that meet the demands of last-mile delivery. Key components include:

- **Multi-Stop Route Optimization:** The system will support multi-stop route generation, allowing for the most efficient sequence of stops across multiple delivery points. This feature will reduce travel distances and ensure smoother operations by minimizing time spent on the road.

- **Real-Time Traffic Integration:** Traffic data will be integrated in real-time, enabling the system to consider current traffic conditions when optimizing routes. This will help avoid delays and ensure delivery routes are recalculated dynamically to accommodate changing road conditions.

- **Time Window Handling:** The system will incorporate time window constraints, allowing deliveries to be scheduled within specific time frames. This ensures that priority deliveries are completed within deadlines and that customers receive packages within expected time slots.

- **Priority Delivery Support:** Deliveries with high priority or specific customer requirements will be managed through prioritization capabilities, allowing these deliveries to be completed first or within the requested time frames.

- **Dynamic Re-Routing:** To account for unexpected road closures, new delivery requests, or traffic incidents, the system will support dynamic re-routing. This feature will enable drivers to adapt their routes as conditions change, minimizing disruptions and ensuring timely deliveries.

- **Customer Notification System:** To improve customer satisfaction, the system will provide automated notifications to customers, keeping them updated on delivery statuses. Notifications may include estimated delivery times, alerts for route changes, and confirmation upon delivery completion.
