## Nonfunctional Requirements

Nonfunctional requirements define the overall system qualities that ensure a seamless, secure, and performant experience for all users. This section outlines the key performance and security criteria for the route optimization platform, focusing on responsiveness, scalability, and data protection.

### 2.3.1 Performance

Performance requirements are critical to ensuring that the route optimization platform operates efficiently, providing fast response times and a smooth user experience. Key performance requirements include:

- **Route Calculation:** The system must be capable of calculating optimized routes for up to 100 stops in less than 5 seconds. This ensures that delivery drivers and dispatchers can quickly receive accurate routes without delays, even for complex deliveries with multiple stops.
  
- **API Response Time:** The API must respond to requests in under 200 milliseconds, ensuring fast data retrieval and interactions between the mobile app, web interfaces, and the backend system. This performance is crucial for maintaining an uninterrupted user experience.

- **App Launch Time:** The application should launch in under 3 seconds to ensure users can quickly access the features they need without long waiting times. Fast app load times contribute to user satisfaction and usability.

- **Offline Data Sync:** When the app is used offline, data synchronization should occur in less than 1 minute once connectivity is restored. This ensures that delivery data, route information, and status updates are quickly synced without manual intervention, allowing drivers to continue their work seamlessly.

### 2.3.2 Security

Security is a fundamental aspect of the route optimization platform, especially when handling sensitive customer, driver, and logistics data. The system will adhere to robust security practices to protect data integrity and privacy. Key security requirements include:

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All communication between the mobile application, web interfaces, and backend system will be encrypted using end-to-end encryption protocols. This will prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, ensuring that delivery details, customer information, and driver locations are securely transmitted.

- **Secure Authentication:** The system will implement secure authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for both drivers and administrators. This will help ensure that only authorized users can access the platform and its features, protecting the integrity of the system.

- **GDPR Compliance:** The platform will comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect the personal data of European Union customers and users. This includes ensuring transparency in data collection, providing users with the ability to access and delete their data, and ensuring that all data handling practices meet GDPR standards.

- **Data Privacy Measures:** The system will enforce strict data privacy measures to protect user information. This will include anonymizing customer data where possible, limiting access to sensitive data based on user roles, and ensuring that data is stored securely and deleted when no longer needed.

By adhering to these performance and security requirements, the route optimization platform will provide a fast, secure, and reliable service that meets the needs of both logistics providers and end users.
