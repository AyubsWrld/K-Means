To develop an effective and user-friendly route optimization platform, the system must meet a range of technical requirements that ensure compatibility, usability, and efficiency. These requirements are critical for delivering a seamless experience to delivery drivers and logistics managers in various operating environments. The following sections outline the essential components of the system, starting with the mobile application.

### 2.0.1 Mobile Application

The mobile application will serve as the primary interface for delivery drivers, providing them with real-time routing information, tracking updates, and communication capabilities. Key requirements include:

- **iOS and Android Compatibility:** The application will be developed with native support for both iOS and Android operating systems to ensure accessibility for a broad range of users. This cross-platform compatibility will enable drivers to use the app on their preferred devices, enhancing adoption and convenience.

- **Offline Functionality for Areas with Poor Connectivity:** To ensure continuous operation in areas with limited or no internet access, the application will include offline capabilities. Maps, routes, and essential instructions will be preloaded, allowing drivers to complete deliveries without interruption, even in low-connectivity regions.

- **Real-Time GPS Tracking:** The application will utilize GPS technology to provide accurate, real-time tracking of delivery locations. This will allow logistics managers to monitor driver positions, track delivery progress, and make adjustments as needed for optimal route efficiency.

- **Push Notifications:** Push notifications will provide drivers with timely updates, including route changes, delivery time adjustments, and other critical information. This ensures that drivers receive essential information immediately, allowing for quick and responsive actions.

- **Low Battery Consumption:** Given the long hours required for delivery operations, the application will be optimized for low battery usage. Efficient use of GPS, background processes, and other battery-intensive features will be implemented to extend device battery life during prolonged usage.

### 2.0.2 Web Application

The web application will serve as the central hub for logistics managers and administrators, providing a comprehensive interface to manage deliveries, optimize routes, and track performance metrics. Key requirements include:

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** The web application will be compatible with all major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure seamless access across different platforms and user preferences.

- **Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring:** The web app will feature an intuitive dashboard that displays real-time updates on driver locations, delivery statuses, and route progress. This enables managers to make data-driven decisions quickly and effectively.

- **User Role Management:** The system will include user role management capabilities, allowing administrators to assign roles and permissions. This ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized personnel while enabling collaborative workflows.

- **Interactive Map Interface:** An interactive map will allow logistics managers to visualize delivery routes, monitor driver movements, and identify potential delays or issues. Features like drag-and-drop adjustments will provide flexibility in managing delivery schedules.

- **Analytics and Reporting:** The web application will generate detailed reports on key metrics such as delivery times, fuel consumption, and driver performance. These insights will help logistics teams identify trends, optimize operations, and make informed strategic decisions.

- **Secure Data Handling:** Robust security measures, including data encryption, secure authentication, and regular updates, will be implemented to protect sensitive delivery and customer information from unauthorized access.

- **Integration with Third-Party Services:** The web app will support integrations with popular logistics and fleet management tools, allowing seamless data exchange and expanded functionality. Examples include CRM systems, payment gateways, and inventory management platforms.
