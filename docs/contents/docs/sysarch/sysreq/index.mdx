## System Requirements

To develop an effective and user-friendly route optimization platform, the system must meet a range of technical requirements that ensure compatibility, usability, and efficiency. These requirements are critical for delivering a seamless experience to delivery drivers and logistics managers in various operating environments. The following sections outline the essential components of the system, starting with the mobile application.

### Mobile Application

The mobile application will serve as the primary interface for delivery drivers, providing them with real-time routing information, tracking updates, and communication capabilities. Key requirements include:

- **iOS and Android Compatibility:** The application will be developed for both iOS and Android platforms to ensure accessibility for a broad range of users. This cross-platform compatibility will enable drivers to use the app on their preferred devices, enhancing adoption and convenience.

- **Offline Functionality for Areas with Poor Connectivity:** To ensure continuous operation in areas with limited or no internet access, the application will include offline capabilities. Maps, routes, and essential instructions will be preloaded, allowing drivers to complete deliveries without interruption, even in low-connectivity regions.

- **Real-Time GPS Tracking:** The application will utilize GPS technology to provide accurate, real-time tracking of delivery locations. This will allow logistics managers to monitor driver positions, track delivery progress, and make adjustments as needed for optimal route efficiency.

- **Push Notifications:** Push notifications will provide drivers with timely updates, including route changes, delivery time adjustments, and other critical information. This ensures that drivers receive essential information immediately, allowing for quick and responsive actions.

- **Low Battery Consumption:** Given the long hours required for delivery operations, the application will be optimized for low battery usage. Efficient use of GPS, background processes, and other battery-intensive features will be implemented to extend device battery life during prolonged usage.

- **Minimal Storage Requirements (under 100MB):** To accommodate devices with limited storage space, the application will be lightweight, requiring less than 100MB of storage. This ensures that the app can be installed on a wide range of devices without causing storage constraints.
